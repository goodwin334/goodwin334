## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Gabe Goodwin and I'm a data-driven professional with a background in finance and a growing expertise in data science and analytics. My career began in the investment and credit sectorsâ€”first as an Investment Analyst at a money management firm, where I executed trades and monitored market activity, and later as a Credit Analyst at a commercial bank, underwriting loans for businesses across various industries.  I would do projection modeling along with running Probability of Default and Loss Given Default models on our borrowers.

Recently, I completed an intensive Data Science program through TripleTen, where I honed my skills in Python and SQL. The program covered a wide range of topics including Exploratory and Statistical Data Analysis, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning, Linear Algebra, Numerical Methods, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision.

I'm actively looking to transition into roles in data analysis, quantitative research, or data engineeringâ€”where I can merge my financial expertise with technical proficiency to derive insights, build models, and solve real-world problems with data.

My hobbies include working out, reading, sports (specifically football and basketball) and traveling.  I also enjoy educational podcasts that provide me the opportunity to learn in my free time.

I am currently open to participating in outsourcing projects to get better at my coding skill.s
